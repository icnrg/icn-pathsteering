-		<t>A consumer may alternatively request that a forwarder detecting the inconsistency forward the Interest by means of normal LNPM FIB lookup rather than returning an error. The consumer endpoint, if it cares, can keep enough information about outstanding Interests to determine if the path label sent with the Interest fails to match the path label in the corresponding returned Content (Data), and use that information to replace stale path labels. It does so by setting the (TBD mechanism) in its Interest message.</t>

 		<t>A forwarder that receives a Content (Data) message encodes the nexthop label in the next available slot and increments label index. Conversely, a forwarder that receives an Interest message reads the current nexthop label and decrements label index. Therefore, the extra computation required at each hop to forward either an interest or Content Object message with a path label is minimized and constitutes a fairly trivial additional overhead compared to FIB lookup and other required operations.</t>
 
-		<t>This approach results in individual path label TLV instances being of fixed pre-computed size. While this places a hard upper bound on the maximum number of network hops that can be represented, this is not a significant a practical problem in CCNx, since the size can be pre-set during Interest message encoding based on the consumer specified value of the hop-limit. Even long paths of 24 hops will fit in a path label TLV of 36 bytes.</t>
