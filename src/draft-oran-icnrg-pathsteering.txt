                     Path Steering in CCNx and NDN
                  draft-oran-icnrg-pathsteering-latest

Abstract

   Path Steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of
   ICN content objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a
   previously discovered path.  It has various uses, including the
   operation of state-of-the-art multipath congestion control algorithms
   and for network measurement and management.

1.  Introduction

   Path Steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of
   ICN content objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a
   previously discovered path.  It has various uses, including the
   operation of state-of-the-art multipath congestion control algorithms
   and for network measurement and management.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Mapping to CCNx and NDN packet encodings

   TBD

2.1.  Packet encoding for CCNx

   TBD

2.2.  Packet encoding for NDN

   TBD based on [NDNTLV].  Suggestions from the NDN team greatly
   appreciated.
